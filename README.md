## Documentations and Tutorials

We started building the App with Vue and typescript, wich workes best with "class-style" Vue components. We are also using SCSS in our Vue components, which allows nesting, variables and mixins in our CSS. But both is completly optional and you could definitly add components with the default Vue setup and vanilla JS and CSS.

Following some ressources to help you start working on `Heimspiel`.

### Vue

One of the central reasons for Vue's success is it's great documentation. Make sure to check out the guide, cookbook and API section there :blush:
